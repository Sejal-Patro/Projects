        You must include your basic information, educational background,
        relevant skills, and related details about your personality. Remember to
        keep it brief and avoid digressions, as it can backfire on your
        self-introduction. Having a script will help you make an excellent first
        impression.

      Hard work is the key to success. Life cannot grow properly without effort.
      Some believe they can rely solely on luck, but that is rarely true.
      Dedication and perseverance are crucial for happiness and success.

    <p>
      My day-to-day life involves learning new things, enjoying small moments,
      and cherishing meaningful experiences. Recently, I’ve decided to work
      harder and set higher goals for myself. I am passionate about many things,
      especially sports, singing, dancing, and reading fiction novels.

      Last but not least, I believe in two principles: Failure is the pillar of
      success, and confidence is key. Thank you!
